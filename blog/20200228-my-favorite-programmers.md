# My Favorite Programmers
Alot of these people have influced and inspired my career, my programming style, and in many ways, my life aswell. This list is in no particular order, and if my opinions change, instead of editing this list, I will likely create a revised list in the future.

## Ken Thompson
As the inventor of the B programming language, Ken Thompson can be regarded as the earliest influence of the C language. Although B is no longer used today, his foresight into its design has very well shaped the syntax and design of most modern day programming languages.

He was also an inventor and pioneer in some of the most influential operating systems in the world such as Plan 9, Multics, and Unix.

After the 2000s, Ken went on to work at google and co-invent the Go programming language.
